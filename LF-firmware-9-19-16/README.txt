This is what you want to flash if you don't have standalone LF emulation.

This is the most up to date firmware available as of the time of this posting.
The only mod is removal of HF standalone emulation mode from the makefile thus enabling LF mode.

Instructions for using LF standalone emulation/cloning mode on the elechouse RDV2 and standard version of the proxmark3 can be found at:
